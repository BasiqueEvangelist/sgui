# SGui (Server Gui)
It's a small, jij-able library that allows creation of server side guis.
It isn't `stable` yet, but it should generally work.

## Usage:
You need to add jitpack to your repositories and `com.github.Patbox:sgui:[TAG]` as your dependencies

```
repositories {
	maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
}

dependencies {
	modImplementation include("com.github.Patbox:sgui:[TAG]").
}
```
